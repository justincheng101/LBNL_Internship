## Recognizing Faults and Multiscale Features in Mont Terri Using Machine Learning

My project centered around using convolutional neural networks, specifically U-Net and Mask R-CNN, to segment and identify subsurface geological features such as fracture networks and borehole breakouts. An accurate identification and delineation of these features can help predict fault line stability and give early warning signs of induced seismicity, key information for issues of energy storage and nuclear waste disposal.

Many of the notebooks don't load in Github, so I've included their corresponding links below if you would like to view these files without downloading them.
